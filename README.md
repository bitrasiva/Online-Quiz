This is an HTML structure for an online quiz platform. The page is divided into several sections:

Quiz: This section contains the quiz questions and options. The questions are displayed using an unordered list, and each question has a set of options as list items.
Options: This section displays the options for each question. The options are also displayed using an unordered list.
Submit: This button submits the quiz answers and triggers the result display.
Result: This section displays the quiz result, including the correct answer and the score.
The CSS styles for this structure can be found in the "styles.css" file included in the project. The styles define the layout and design of the quiz platform, including the container, sections, and individual elements.

The script.js file (optional) can contain JavaScript code to add interactivity to the quiz platform, such as animations, feedback, or validation.

Overall, this HTML structure provides a basic foundation for creating an online quiz platform. You can add or modify the quiz questions and options as needed, and customize the design and functionality using CSS and JavaScript.
